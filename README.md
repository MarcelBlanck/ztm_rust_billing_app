# Billing App

This app is a mini project in the [Zero to Mastery - Rust Programming: The Complete Developer's Guide](https://zerotomastery.io/courses/learn-rust/) course.

While working on the project I wanted to go a bit further and added a MVC like structure to the code. Further I wanted to use some generics and dynamic typing via traits, plus some other advanced topics which the course covers in the next sections.

While extending the project, I got quite some practice and the whole borrow checking, lifetime, dyn problematic looks a lot less intimidating now after struggling a bit with it.

The project is here mostly to get some reviews or feedback on it. If you have feedback, feel free to contact me.
